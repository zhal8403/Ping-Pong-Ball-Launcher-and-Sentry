## 10/12/2025 8 AM - Planed  

Planned out the look of the handheld ping-pong ball launcher and how it would work by using two DC motors powered by a 3.3V 2200 mAh battery. The launcher will have a long tube that holds several ping-pong balls in a line so it can shoot one at a time or continuously. The motors will spin two wheels that launch each ball forward when the trigger is pressed.

The battery and wiring will be placed in the handle for balance, and if you hold down the trigger, it will cause automatic instead of single fire. The outside will have a simple, compact shape that’s easy to hold and aim.

## 10/12/2025 2 PM - Started CAD  

Started the CAD design of the sentry by making the rollers and path for the ball. I also made a gear for the vertical tilt of the launcher part. I plan on next making a base that gives it horizontal motion and finishing the vertical tilt by making a smaller gear next to the big one powered by a servo for slow but efficient adjustments.

## 11/8/2025 - Initial Feeder Design (Stepper Version)  

CAD:

Designed an initial tube feeder mechanism to hold and load ping pong balls into the launcher.

Integrated mounting points for a stepper motor to rotate and feed one ball at a time.

Ensured ball path alignment with the shooter section to prevent jams. 

CAD Time: 1 hr 30 min

Printing Time: 4 hrs 10 min (PLA, 20% infill, light supports)

Mechanical:

Installed the feeder tube and connected the stepper motor using small short screws.

The stepper motor provided precise control for single-shot loading.

Early mechanical testing showed reliable feeding but slow rotation due to motor torque limits.

Testing:

The stepper functioned well initially but later failed mechanically.

Feed timing was consistent before failure.

Mechanical/Testing Time: 4 hrs
