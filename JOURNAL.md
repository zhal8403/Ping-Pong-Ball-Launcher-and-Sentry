This is my journal of the design and building process of **Ping Pong Ball Launcher and Sentry**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/441).


## 10/12/2025 - Planed  

Planned out the look of the handheld ping-pong ball launcher and how it would work by using two DC motors powered by a 3.3V 2200 mAh battery. The launcher will have a long tube that holds several ping-pong balls in a line so it can shoot one at a time or continuously. The motors will spin two wheels that launch each ball forward when the trigger is pressed.

The battery and wiring will be placed in the handle for balance, and if you hold down the trigger, it will cause automatic instead of single fire. The outside will have a simple, compact shape that’s easy to hold and aim.
